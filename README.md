# blender-addon-gotoframe

This is a simple add-on for Blender, that allows you to go (jump) to a specific frame on the animation timeline. This makes it easy to navigate the animation timeline from the keyboard. 

After you've installed the add-on, hit <kbd>F3</kbd> to search for "_go fra_" to find the custom operator.
